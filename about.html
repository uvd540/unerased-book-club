<h2>How do we select our books?</h2>
<!-- <div class="two_col"> -->
    <!-- <div> -->
        There are plenty of fantastic books by Asian Americans to choose from, so we have developed a few parameters to
        help us narrow our choices.
        <ol>
            <li>Ease of acquiring book. If a piece of literature is available in audibook/ebook formats, or libraries
                can affordably acquire it, it makes the first cut!</li>
            <li>Thought-provoking and accessible content. We think about the types of conversation we can have, and
                whether the writing is accessible to a general audience when making second round cuts.</li>
            <li>The work primes readers to explore topics from multiple perspectives. We love to have our views
                challenged and broadened, so works that helps us think differently make the third cut.</li>
            <li>Genre and social identities. In order to read diversely, we try to have a mix of genres (poetry,
                fiction, nonfiction, etc.) and social identities (particularly regional diversity) in our selections.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>UBC was created by Sheela Lal in 2018. She attempted to maintain it while finishing graduate school, and
            realized that for the concept to thrive, it needed a stronger home.</p>
        <p>Luckily, <a href="http://risingvoicesaaf.org/">Rising Voices</a> was open to taking in UBC as a way to build
            community in Michigan and to continue building community throughout the country.</p>
