1. Weaved through the stories is the theme of memories, real, imagined, mythically transformed. How does the way Chang uses memory transform our experiences of reading? 
1. How are mothers represented in these stories? What mother and daughter relationships resonated with you?
1. Stories about the relationship between mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws are ubiquitous in Asian (Asian American) literature/media (as well as African literature). How does this compare to American literature? What representations can you think of?
