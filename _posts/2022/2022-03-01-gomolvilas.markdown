## Context Links
- Pan Asian Repertory ([Theater][theater])
- ‘The Brothers Paranormal’ blends horror, comedy and drama in a tale of displacement and loss ([The Oregonian][or])

## Guiding Questions 
1. When was the last time you read a play? How did reading a contemporary play differ or compare?
2. The main families are Thai and Black; both have strong reactions to the idea of the paranormal. What commentary did you glean from this?
3. What does a play offer storytelling that’s different from more talked about genres?
4. Another theme is migration. How does that show up across place and time?
