## Guiding Questions 
1. What do we learn about Guahan (Guam) in this collection? How familiar were you with its history prior to reading this collection? 
1. Discuss the role of the US military in the history and environment of Guahan. 
1. This collection seeks to interrogate the meaning of “home”, especially in the context of migration due to colonialism, military occupation, and economic necessity. How is “home” then defined? Where is home? Who gets to call it “home?” Can “home” be reclaimed after one’s land has been colonized and militarized?
1. The author uses a variety of stylistic devices to tell multiple interwoven stories (notice the use of italics, strikethroughs, poetry and prose). How does this affect our experience of reading this collection? What does this styling add to our understanding of Guahan?
